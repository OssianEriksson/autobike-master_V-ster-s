# Autobike project

This repository contains the code that is beeing used within the Autobike project on Chalmers. The main part of the code is made with the portable bike in mind,
but it should work with other versions of the bike as well even if some minor adaptions might be necessary.

For the report written in connection to this project, see: https://github.com/Hannnes1/Bachelor-thesis

Below is a list of the files and folders within the repository.

* ### `labview`

The LabVIEW code that controls the bike. The main file in this project is the one called `MainTest.vi`.

* ### `balancing`

This folder contains C code to controll the steering motor in a way that prevents the bike from falling over. This code does not consider the bikes
path at the moment.

* ### `vesc_encoder`

C code to calculate UART commands that should be sent to the VESC, based the input. Functions exist for both RPM and current control.

* ### `plot_data.m`

A MATLAB script for plotting TDMS files generated by the LabVIEW program.

* ### `Ni Linux Real-time Template`

A template that can be used as a base for creating `.so` files for the MyRIO. The `.vscode` folder is specific to Visual Studio Code, and enables
compilation and linking without the use of a terminal.

* ### `Python_backup_20220402`

Snapshot of the python code that is used to control the black bike. Some parts of this code has been translated into C, and can be found in the various
other folders. The majority of the code is not relevant for the red bike, however, since it has the same functionality as the LabVIEW code.
